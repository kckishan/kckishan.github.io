abstract = "Predicting protein-protein interactions (PPIs) by learning informative representations from amino acid sequences is a challenging yet important problem in biology. Although various deep learning models in Siamese architecture have been proposed to model PPIs from sequences, these methods are computationally expensive for a large number of PPIs due to the pairwise encoding process. Furthermore, these methods are difficult to interpret because of non-intuitive mappings from protein sequences to their sequence representation. To address these challenges, we present a novel deep framework to model and predict PPIs from sequence alone. Our model incorporates a bidirectional gated recurrent unit to learn sequence represen- tations by leveraging contextualized and sequential information from sequences. We further employ a sparse regularization to model long-range dependencies between amino acids and to select important amino acids (protein motifs), thus enhancing interpretability. Besides, the novel design of the encoding process makes our model computationally efficient and scalable to an increasing number of interactions. Experimental results on up- to-date interaction datasets demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art meth- ods. Literature-based case studies illustrate the ability of our model to provide biological insights to interpret the predictions."
