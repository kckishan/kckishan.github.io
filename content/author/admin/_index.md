I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the GCCIS program at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). I am a Graduate Research Assistant at the Lab of Use-Inspired Computational Intelligence (LUCI) under the supervision of [Dr. Anne Haake](https://www.rit.edu/directory/arhics-anne-haake) and [Dr. Rui Li](https://ruililuci.com).

**Research**\
My research aims in developing data-driven models by incorporating relational inductive bias to represent and interpret the complex interplay between various components in a biological system. Specifically, my Ph.D. focuses on graph representation learning and neural architecture inference to predict the missing interactions in the (biomedical) networks.
