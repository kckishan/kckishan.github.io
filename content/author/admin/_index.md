I am an Applied Scientist at Amazon Alexa AI Search, working on Question Answering systems. I joined Amazon as a full-time Applied Scientist in February 2022. During my internship at the Alexa Speaker identification team last summer, I worked with Zhenning Tan to develop an open-set few-shot learning framework to improve speaker identification.

I obtained my Ph.D. in Computing and Information Sciences at Rochester Institute of Technology. In my Ph.D. thesis, I focused on developing scalable probabilistic machine learning models to learn the representation of network structured data. Furthermore, I developed Bayesian model selection to infer the most plausible neural network structure warranted by data.
