I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in the GCCIS program at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). I am a ***Graduate Research Assistant*** at the *Lab of Use-Inspired Computational Intelligence (LUCI)* under the supervision of [**Dr. Anne Haake**](https://www.rit.edu/directory/arhics-anne-haake) and [**Dr. Rui Li**](https://ruililuci.com).

**Research**\
My broad research interests include probabilistic machine learning, network representation learning, link prediction and machine learning for scientific benefit.
